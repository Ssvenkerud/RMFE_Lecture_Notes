    "# Using Git for version control and changelog\n",
    "by: Simen Svenkerud\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Control System**: This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Version Control System**: The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distributed Version Control System**: Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Git \n",
    "\n",
    "Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers. Further reasons include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "It’s obvious that with regular checkpoints, your work is more safe since you can hit the “undo” button when you go down dead ends. But there’s some related benefits that are perhaps not as obvious. The first is that you’re likely to also be syncing with a remote git server, like GitHub, so your work is backed up on a different machine. By using version control, you’ve automatically gained the benefit of backing up your work. That may not matter when everything is working well, but it will matter a great deal when you spill coffee on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the additional safety leads to a greater willingness to experiment. Instead of modifying a function directly, how many times have you copied/pasted it, added “_v2” to the name, and then modified it, just in case you might want to revert back? This is poor man’s version control, and it results in a mess. With checkpoints, you’re free to make bold changes without worry because you can always revert. Dead ends can be deleted, breakthroughs can be merged, and potentially useful tangents can just sit on the shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarity\n",
    "When you are free to remove code that isn’t relevant to the particular task at hand, your code becomes more focused and clear. If the new model you’re currently testing doesn’t use that dead-end feature engineering code block, then delete it. This avoids the growth of a big web of incomprehensible code that emerges from experimentation in an environment of uncertainty about the end result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeatability\n",
    "When you have code spread across multiple copies of Jupyter notebooks that need to be run in a very particular order to produce the model, then you have a repeatability problem. While it’s probably a bad idea to use Jupyter notebooks for anything except early experimentation, using version control to keep your code concise/clean reduces the risk and makes it easier to port into a proper module. Future You or Future Teammate will be very happy that there’s exactly one data pipeline and one model build.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk thrugh how to set up and use git in your work process. All directly Git related comands start with **\"git\"**. \n",
    "It is important to note that while there are graphical interfaces for using git, these are mostly third party or attached to remote repositories. Git itself is primarily a comandline tool. For the sake of this notebook we will focus on the comandline version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First time set up\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is to initiate a git repository. That is to say tell git that you want the content of this folder to be tracked. Navigate to the folder in question and run"
